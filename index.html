                <h1>Welcome to my portfolio website!<br> This is my "about me" page!</h1>
                <p>Hello! My name is Mariana Arroyo. I was born in the beach city of Galveston, Texas in December of 1999, but was raised in Houston, Texas through out most of my life til I recently move to Cleveland, Ohio for college.<br>I was raised my mum and dad who are originally from a small village in Mexico called Ixtapan de la Sal, but decided to move to the U.S during the mid 90's.<br> Growing up, my brother and I were obssessed with the cartoons and animated movies when that we were kids, as a matter of fact, Disney's <i>Hunchback of Notre Dame</i> was one of my insperations in getting into art. As I got older, my main goal in life was to become an artist and hopefully create a graphic novel of sorts in future. As of right now, I currently go to the Cleveland Institute of Art and currently interested in majoring in illustration.  </p>
